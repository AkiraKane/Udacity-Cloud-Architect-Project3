# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

1. add the firewall in the front of instances
2. add the NACLs to allow or deny specific traffic to access the subnets
3. Disable the SSH connection from internet, we can enforce the security group rules or 
deploy a bastion instance.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Yes. since everyhing is happened in the VPC and we do not need to use internet gateway and
public IP addresses to communicate with resources in S3, which is more secure.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No. the existed data is still not encrypted. it is only applied for data uploaded after we enable the encryption.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

Cloudformation will replace any changes what we made via Console or CLI.
