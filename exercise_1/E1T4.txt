Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

###################### Poor practice 1 #####################################

I've digged into the security group for the webapp, which is open to all traffic for all ports. 
This is the worst vulnerbility for the attackers to exploit and easily access to our webapp. 
We should remove it and put webapp in the private subnet. 

Instead of exposing to port 80, we can establish a more secure port 443, or using the SSL termination 
on application load balancer to improve security. 

Instead of exposing to port 22 directly to allow ssh connection, we can deploy a bastion 
instance in the public subnet to accomplish this. 

Last but not least, we should restrict the traffic to webapp port 5000 from the 
security group of load balancer only

####################### Poor practice 2 ########################################

I've digged into the IAM role to allow webapp instance to retrieve the S3 object in c3-app.yml file.
It seems that it voilate the principle of least privileges. Instead of assigning permissions of 
allowing all S3 actions on all S3 buckets to EC2 instance, we should restrict to the least
privileges to specific buckets and to perform the neccesary jobs.

######################### Poor practice 3 ###################################

Instead of using internet gateway to access to S3 buecket, we should expose the S3 endpoint only 
restricted to VPC.
