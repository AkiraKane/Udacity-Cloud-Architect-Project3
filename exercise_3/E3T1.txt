# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

My EC2 instance has been involved in SSH brute force attacks.

This finding indicates that an EC2 instance in AWS was involved in a brute force attack 
aimed at obtaining passwords to SSH services on Linux-based systems. 

This can indicate unauthorized access to the AWS resources.


# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

To detect unauthorized and unexpected activity in your AWS environment, 
GuardDuty analyzes and processes data from AWS CloudTrail event logs, VPC Flow Logs, 
and DNS logs.

In our case, we have both CloudTrial logs and VPC flow logs. However, Guard Duty is mostly likely
analyzing the VPC logs to detect this attack, since it contains most of the information about 
our traffics and IP addresses between instances.
